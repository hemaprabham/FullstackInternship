                    <p> Athirappilly Falls is a waterfall in Kerala, India. It's the largest
                        waterfall in the state, standing at 81.5 feet tall. The falls are located on the Chalakudy
                        River, which originates in the Western Ghats.
                        <br><br>The falls are also known as the "Niagara of South India" and "Bahubali Waterfall".
                        They're made up of four drops and fall in parallel streams.
                        The Chalakudy River runs slowly until it reaches Athirappilly, where it picks up speed and falls
                        over the 80-foot rock. The river remains turbulent for about a kilometer.
                        Visitors can swim in the clear waters of the falls. The falls are open Thursday through Sunday
                        from 8 AMâ€“6 PM, with last admission at 5:30 PM.
                        <br><br>To reach the main waterfall, visitors must walk about two kilometers from the entry
                        gate. Some say you can spot wildlife like mountain squirrels, hornbills, sambhar deer, leopards,
                        and elephants in the canopy.
